# Metabolomics: Compound Identification via Spectral Library Matching with Novel Entropy Similarity Measures

We have constructed two novel similarity measures based on R\'enyi and Tsallis Entropy to quantify the similarity between two probability distributions. Our original motivation for constructing these similarity measures is to improve compound identification via spectral library matching with respect to either liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) or gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). We constructed these similarity measures by generalizing the Shannon Entropy similarity measure presented by Li et. al. in the publication ([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01331-z#citeas)) referenced below.
